# Matic.js on the Browser

To use Matic.js on simple HTML projects, this directory contains some sample files

This simple demo uses `browserify` to use the SDK in a simple HTML file. It can be extended according the use case.

## Usage

```bash
# inside the `examples/web` directory

$ npm ci
$ npm run build # builds a `bundle.js` from `main.js`

```

Open `index.html` in your browser and check console to get a matic object. You can refer API docs to now use this object for function calls on the client side.
